# HookMarked: The Open Webhook Protocol

**HookMarked** is an open, developer-friendly protocol for defining, validating, and delivering webhooks securely and reliably — inspired by OpenAPI, built for real-time systems.

---

## 🔧 What’s Included

- `/.well-known/hooks.json` discovery spec
- JSON Schema-based webhook definitions
- Signed delivery via HMAC SHA-256
- Retry policies and delivery metadata
- CLI tool to validate payloads and specs
- Ecosystem of SDKs and integrations (coming soon)

## Repos

- [`hookmarked-spec`](https://github.com/hookmarked/hookmarked-spec): Protocol spec & RFCs  
- [`hookmarked-cli`](https://github.com/hookmarked/hookmarked-cli): Validator and simulation CLI  
- [`hookmarked-site`](https://github.com/hookmarked/hookmarked-site): Docs + homepage

## Philosophy

We believe webhooks should be:
- Discoverable
- Secure by default
- Schema-defined and testable
- Retry-safe and traceable

Let’s make webhooks boring — and beautiful.
